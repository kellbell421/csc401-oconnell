Idea for Application:

The web application I am going to create is going to be a "fashion closet". The user will have the ability to login and logout of this website. The concept of this application is to create outfits with the clothing that is put onto your account and store them in the "closet". The user can upload pictures of the clothing they own and divide them into sections (different tabs) on the site. The user can select one thing from the tab and add it to the outfit, which is then stored into the closet. They can also add/delete clothing from the closet.
