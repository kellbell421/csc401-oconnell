Idea for Application:

The web application I am going to create is going to be a "fashion closet". The user will have the ability to login and logout of this website. The concept of this application is to create outfits with the clothing that is put onto your account and store them in the "closet". The user can upload pictures of the clothing they own and divide them into sections (different divs/columns) on the homepage. These sections will be tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories. Each column will have a drop-down tab to show the different types of tops/bottoms etc. and the user will upload the picture into one of the drop-down tabs depending on the type of clothing. The user can select one thing from the tab (a select buttons will be used for this) and add it to the outfit (which appears on the side of the section they are under), which is then stored into the closet. They can also add/delete clothing from the current outfit they are working with. They can also delete outfits from the closet.
